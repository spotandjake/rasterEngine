# RasterEngine
This is a test base for writing a 3dRaster Engine


This is going to be a precursor to a rendering engine built in c# using xna hence some odd design decisions, such as extracting the drawing logic to seperate class. I decided to use vite and typescript so we are working more closely to how c# will end up working.
